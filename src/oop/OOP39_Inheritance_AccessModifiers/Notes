        Collection of variables and methods

        public class Vehicle{

            //instance variables 
            //instance methods
        }

Types of variables:
	- Local Variables:  
			-> A variable defined within a block or method or constructor
			-> Created when the block in entered or the method is called and destroyed after exiting from block, 
				or when the call returns from method
			-> Scope of these variables exists only within the block in which the variable is declared
			-> Initializition is mandatory

	- Instance Variables: 
			-> Non-static variables and are declared in a class outside any method, constructor, or block
			-> Created when an object of the class is created and destroyed  when the object is destroyed
			-> Unlike local variables, we may use access modifiers. If we do not specify any modifier then 
				default access specifier will be used
			-> Initialization is not mandatory.
			-> Can be accessed only by creating objects

	- Static Variables: 
			-> Also known as class variables.
			-> Declared using the static keyword within a class outside any method, constructor or block.
			-> We can ony have one copy of static variables per class
			-> Created at the start of the program execution and destroyed automatically when execution ends
			-> Initialization is not mandatory
			-> We can access thru class name. className.staticVariable;

Encapsulation : Data hiding
                private variables, public getter, public setter


			    public class Vehicle{
			        private String name;
			        private String size;
			        private int currentVelocity;
			        private int currentDirection;
			        
			        public String getName() {
			            return name;
			        }
			
			        public String getSize() {
			            return size;
			        }
			
			        public void setName(String name){
			            this.name=name;
			        }
			
			        public void setSize(String size){
			            this.size=size;
			        }
			    }

Constructor:
			 -> Special method that initializes a created object.
             -> new keyword invoked the constructor. 
             -> Constructors does not have return type.
             -> Constructors have the same name as the class.
             -> If we do not define a constructor, compiler creates default constructor.(no argument)
             -> We can overload constructors like methods (number of parameters,types of parameters,and order of parameters)
             -> We can call one constructor from another constructor with this() keyword


		    public Vehicle(String name, String size) {
		        this.name = name;
		        this.size = size;
		
		        this.currentVelocity = 0;
		        this.currentDirection = 0;
		    }

Inheritance:
 			-> One class inherits the features(fields and methods) of another class.
            -> The Subclass can add its own fields and methods in addition to the superclass fields and methods.
            -> The keyword used for inheritance is extends 
            -> Constructors are not inherited

             public class Car extends Vehicle(){

                    //variables
                    //methods
             }

             -> super() keyword is used to call parent class constructor.
             -> If subclass does not call a superclass constructor, java will automatically call the superclass's 
             default constructor.
             -> if parent class only has constructor with parameters, then child constructor MUST make a matching 
             	super(params) calls
             -> super() needs to be the first statement in the constructor.

Overriding: Declaring a method in subclass which is already present in the parent class
            - > There must be a IS-A relationship
            - > Method must have same name and same parameters in parent class
            - > Access modifiers should be same or more visible
            - > Return type must be same or covariant type
            
            
            public class Vehicle{

                public void methodA(int a,int b,String x){}
            }

            public Car extends Vehicle{

                public void methodA(int a,int b,String x){}

            }



			class Vehicle {
				public Vehicle move(String direction) {
					return new Vehicle();
				}
			}

			class Van extends Vehicle {
				public Vehicle move(String direction) {
					return new Vehicle();
				}
			}


			class Van extends Vehicle {
				// Notice the covariant return type Van here, which is subtype of Vehicle
				public Van move(String direction) {
					return new Van();
				}
			}

this vs super : 
			-> super is used to call the parent class members
            -> this is used to call the current class members
            -> We can use both of them anywhere

this() vs super() : 
			-> this() is used to call constructor from another overloaded constructor
            -> super() is used to call a parent constructor
            -> this() and super() can not be used together in the same constructor

Access Modifiers: 
			- > public, protected, default, private
			- > variables, constructors, methods can have all 4 access modifiers.

		    private members are accessible:
		    	- only within the defining class
				
		    default members are accessible:
		    	- within the defining class
		    	- in another class in the same package as the defining class
				
		    protected members are accessible:
		    	- within the defining class
		    	- in another class in the same package as the defining class
		    	- in the derived class defined in any package (through inheritance)
		    	- It is used to make sure the class variables are accessible only to subclasses
				
		    public members are accessible:
		    	- within the defining class
		    	- in another class in the same package as the defining class
		    	- in a class defined in another package
