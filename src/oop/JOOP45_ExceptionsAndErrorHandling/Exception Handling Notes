Exception handling Review 

WHy we need it?
	- Friendly message to user. Give user a unique exception identifier and information
	- Enough information for Support team/ Developer team to debug the problem 

try {
	// exception
}catch(Exception e) {
	// handle exception 
}

Multiple catch blocks 

	try {

	}catch(ArithmeticException e) {

	}catch(NullPointerException e) {

	}catch(Exception e)

Rule: Handle more specialized exception class before general exception classes 

What is the need for finally block?

class Connection  {
	
	void open() {
		System.out.println("Connection opened");
	}
	void close(){
		System.out.println("Connection closed");
	}
}

public class Test {
	
	public static void main(String [] args) {

		method1();
		System.out.println("Line after exception - Main");
	}

	public static void method1() {
		method2();
		System.out.println("Line after Exception - method1");
	}

	public static void method2() {

		try {
			Connection connection = new Connection();
			connection.open();

			String str = null;
			str.toString();

			connection.close();
		}catch(Exception e) {
			System.out.println("Line after Exception - method2");
		}
	}
}


Output:

Connection opened
Exception handled - Method2
Line after Exception - Method1
Line after - Main 
Connection closed 

Finally block is always executed (even when an exception is thrown). So if we want some code to be always executed we can more it to finally block 

In what scenarios i code in finally not executed? 	
	
	- If exception is thrown in finally
	- If JVM crashes 

Finally will be executed even if there is a return statement in try catch block 


	public static void method2() {

		try {
			Connection connection = new Connection();
			connection.open();

			String str = null;
			str.toString();

		}catch(Exception e) {
			System.out.println("Line after Exception - method2");
		}finally {
			connection.close();
		}
	}

Is try without catch allowed?
	
	- Yes it is

		try {
			Connection connection = new Connection();
			connection.open();

			String str = null;
			str.toString();

		}finally {

			connection.close();
		}

Is try without catch and finally allowed? 	

	- No it is not

		try {
			Connection connection = new Connection();
			connection.open();

			String str = null;
			str.toString();

		} //  compile error

Explain the hierarchy of exception handling classes? 

	Throwable is the highest level of Error handling classes

	class Error extends Throwable{}
	class Exception extends Throwable {}
	class RuntimeException extends Exception {}

	//Programmer defined classes
    class CheckedException1 extends Exception{}
    class CheckedException2 extends CheckedException1{}
    class UncheckedException extends RuntimeException{}
    class UncheckedException2 extends UncheckedException{}

What is the difference between Error and Exception?
    - Error: is used in situations where there is nothing programmer can do about it
         Ex: StackOverFlowError,OutOfMemomaryerror
    - Exception : is used when a programmer can handle the exception

What is the difference between CheckedExceptions and UncheckedException?
	- UncheckedException : Error and RuntimeException and classes that extends them are called UncheckedException.
	These are the exceptions that you should not handle in your program. Code will compile even we handle or not
	- CheckedExceptions : Other exceptions classes are checked exceptions. These are the exceptions you should handle in your program.
	    - Try-catch
	    - Throws declaration

Throw claues?
    - It can be used to throw an exception manually. We can throw either checked or UncheckedException
    throw new ExceptionType(MessageString);
This will not compile. To able compile you need to handle it. 1)throws declaration 2)try-catch
class AmountAdder{
    static Amount addAmounts(Amount amount1,Amount amount2){
        if(!amount1.currency.equals(amount2.currency)){
            throw new Exception("Currencies do not match");
        }
        return new Amount(amount1.currency,amount1.amount+amount2.amount);
    }
}

throws clause?
    - Throws clause informs the compiler that a method throws one or more exceptions.
class AmountAdder{
    static Amount addAmounts(Amount amount1,Amount amount2) throws Exception {
        if(!amount1.currency.equals(amount2.currency)){
            throw new Exception("Currencies do not match");
        }
        return new Amount(amount1.currency,amount1.amount+amount2.amount);
    }
}

Rule : When you declare a checked exception, whoever calls this method is responsible to handle it or redeclare it

Option-1
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception{
        AmountAdder.addAmounts(new Amount("usd",50),new Amount("euro",5));
    }

Option-2
    public static void main(String[] args){
        try{
            AmountAdder.addAmounts(new Amount("usd",50),new Amount("euro",5));
        }catch(Exception e){
            System.out.println("Exception handled in main");
        }
        
    }
}catch(Exception e){
	D
	E
}finally{
	F
}
K

1 - No error: A B C F K
2- A has error : nothing
3- C has a problem: A B D E F K
4- C and D has error: A B F and execution stops, show error
